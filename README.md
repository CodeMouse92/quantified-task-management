# Your Tasks, Measured.

How do you measure a task? The question has plagued project managers, software engineers, and product owners alike for decades. Do we measure in urgency? Estimated time? Work produced? Or can tasks only be measured relative to one another? None of these answers ever quite represent all the complexity a single task contains.

This is where Quantified Tasks comes in. By considering six attributes of any task – attributes you probably already think about – and placing them on five point scales, you unlock significant, practical insight into your tasks, your sprints, and the project as a whole. Best of all, this insight is easily shared and understood by all stakeholders in the project: stakeholders, product owners, managers, and developers of all experience levels. Quantified Tasks informs project goals, schedules, sprint planning, and allocation of work.

Quantified Tasks is to estimation and planning what Agile is to project management.

## Where are the repository files?

We migrated from GitHub to Substack for the official Quantified Tasks website. This repository may be repurposed later for a public standards document.
