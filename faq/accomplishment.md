# Measuring Accomplishment

Over the years, many software engineering managers have faced the challenge of measuring
accomplishment of developers. There have been many failed attempts at solving this:

* Counting lines of code written encourages writing complicated code, and doesn't reward
  developers for improving efficiency and code health, which will typically result in
  negative line counts.

* Counting shipped features discourages developers from paying down technical debt and
  maintaining legacy systems, as such work becomes invisible and thankless.

* Counting hours worked punishes efficiency and encourages overwork and poor time management.

* Counting closed tasks makes no differentiation between easy tasks and hard tasks. A developer
  who closes a dozen easy frontend fixes looks better in this light than the one who developer
  that developed an innovative AI model to respond to search requests.

* Counting story points never made sense, because who can say what one story point is even worth?

Quantified Tasks is the first real solution to this problem! Friction, Relativity,
Gravity, and Energy Points are all objective measurements of accomplishment. These still
need to be interpreted in light of the developer's individual skill, but Quantified Tasks
represents a leap forward in measuring work.

## Gravity

The total Gravity of tasks completed by a developer indicates how much value they've provided
from the perspective of the client.

The average Gravity on completed tasks indicates how much alignment there was between the
developer's work and the client's priorities. However, remember that Priority and Gravity
are necessarily distinct concepts. For example, several g3 tasks may have been needed before
a g5 task could practically be implemented.

## Energy Points

Energy Points indicate how much work was completed. Every developer can complete a different
number of Energy Points depending on their seniority, skill level, and familiar with the
project and technology. Over time, this can reveal a developer's increasing skill.

## Distance

The total Distance of tasks completed by a developer is a raw measurement of effort, apart from
research and experimentation. Remember, Distance measures how much effort is involved if
the developer knew everything about the task and the technology involved, so this total will
not include effort for research, experimentation, or learning.

## Friction

The average Friction of tasks completed by a developer indicates the complexity of the work
they completed. Higher Friction indicates that a task objectively involves more research and
experimentation. A high average Friction would mean the developer probably untangled some
difficult problems.

## Relativity

The total Relativity of tasks completed by a developer indicates how much uncertainty, or
"flux," their work involved. Higher flux makes for more challenging work.
